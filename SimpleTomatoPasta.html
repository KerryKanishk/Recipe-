    <h1><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h1>
    <p>The dish typically features a simple sauce made from canned or fresh tomatoes, which are simmered with olive 
        oil and garlic. The heat brings out the natural sweetness of the tomatoes and creates a rich, bright sauce. 
        The sauce is then tossed with your favorite type of pasta, allowing it to cling to every noodle. The final 
        result is a beautiful and tasty meal that is perfect for a quick weeknight dinner. Optional additions like 
        fresh basil and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese can enhance the flavors and give it a more authentic, rustic 
        feel.</p>
