    <h1><strong>SCRAMBLED EGGS</strong></h1>

    <h1><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h1>
    <p>Cheesy scrambled eggs are a classic comfort food, celebrated for their creamy texture and rich, savory taste. 
        This dish transforms a few simple eggs into a wonderfully satisfying meal that can be enjoyed for breakfast, 
        lunch, or dinner. The key to perfect scrambled eggs is a gentle, low-and-slow cooking process that results 
        in large, soft curds rather than small, dry ones. The addition of cheese, which melts into gooey pockets 
        throughout the eggs, adds a luxurious creaminess and a burst of flavor. They are incredibly quick to make 
        and are perfect on their own or served with a side of toast, making them a go-to for a fast and delicious meal.</p>
    <h1><strong>INGREDIENTS: </strong> </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 large eggs</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon milk or cream (optional, but makes them fluffier)</li>

        <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or a mix)</li>

        <li>1/2 tablespoon butter or oil</li>

        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><strong>RECIPE: </strong></h1>
    <ol>
           <li> In a bowl, whisk the eggs with the milk (if using), salt, and pepper until the yolks and whites are fully combined.</li>

            <li>Heat the butter or oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat until it's melted and shimmering.</li>

            <li>Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it sit for a few seconds until the edges just begin to set.</li>
            
            <li> Using a spatula, gently push the cooked eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan, tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow onto the hot surface. Continue this process, folding the eggs until large, soft curds form.</li>

            <li>ust before the eggs are fully cooked (they should still be a little wet), sprinkle the cheese over the top. Cook for another 30 seconds, folding the eggs until the cheese is melted and gooey. Remove from the heat and serve immediately.</li>
