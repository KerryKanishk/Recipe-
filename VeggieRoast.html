    <h1><strong>One-Pan Sausage and Veggie Roast</strong></h1>
    <img src="C:\Users\admin\OneDrive\Desktop\KERRY\03_WebDev\Recipe\Images\Veggie Roast.png">
    <h1><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h1>
    <p>This dish is the epitome of low-effort, high-reward cooking. The magic of a one-pan roast is that all the 
        ingredients—protein and vegetables—are cooked together on a single baking sheet. This not only makes the 
        cooking process incredibly simple but also allows the flavors to meld together beautifully in the oven. 
        The sausages become wonderfully browned and juicy, while the vegetables soften and caramelize, developing 
        a delicious sweetness. Seasoned simply with olive oil and herbs, this dish is a hearty and flavorful meal 
        that requires minimal hands-on time and makes cleanup a breeze.</p>
    <h1><strong>INGREDIENTS: </strong> </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pre-cooked sausage (e.g., kielbasa, Italian sausage), sliced into 1-inch pieces</li>

        <li>3 cups mixed vegetables, cut into bite-sized pieces (e.g., bell peppers, red onion, zucchini, broccoli)</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1><strong>RECIPE: </strong></h1>
    <ol>
           <li> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>

            <li>On a large baking sheet, combine the sliced sausage and chopped vegetables.</li>

            <li>Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
            
            <li> Toss everything together until it's evenly coated. Spread the mixture out in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized. You may want to give the pan a shake halfway through to ensure even cooking.</li>

            <li>Serve hot, straight from the pan.</li>
